# Managing HPCS Service Instances using Terraform Modules

This is a collection of modules that make it easier to provision and manage HPCS Instance IBM Cloud Platform:

* [Provisioning HPCS Instances](./examples/ibm-hpcs-instance)
* [Initialising HPCS Instance](./examples/ibm-hpcs-initialisation)
* [Managing Keys on HPCS Instance](./examples/ibm-hpcs-kms-key)

## HPCS Initialisation Architecture

![HPCS Architecture](./examples/ibm-hpcs-initialisation/references/diagrams/architechture.png?raw=true)
The figure above depicts the basic architecture of the IBM Cloud HPCS Init Terraform Automation.
The main components are..

- **COS Bucket**: HPCS Crypto unit credentials that stored in a Bucket as a json file will be taken as an input by `hpcs-init` terraform module and the secret tke-files that are obtained after execution of template will be stored back as zip file in cos bucket.
- **Terraform**: Reads the terraform configuration files and templates, execute the plan, and communicate with the plugins, manages the resource state and .tfstate file after apply.
- **IBM Cloud TKE Plugin**: The Python script that automates the initialisation process uses IBM CLOUD TKE Plugin

## Terraform versions

Terraform 0.12.

## Usage

Full example is in [main.tf](main.tf)

To run this example you need to execute:

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.

## Example Usage

### Provision HPCS Instance

Note: `provision_instance` will determine if the instance has to be provisioned or not. If `provision_instance` is true, count will be 1 and the instance will be provisioned..
```hcl
module "ibm-hpcs-instance" {
  source = "../../modules/ibm-hpcs-instance"

  provision_instance     = var.provision_instance
  resource_group_id      = data.ibm_resource_group.resource_group.id
  service_name           = var.service_name
  region                 = var.region
  plan                   = var.plan
  tags                   = var.tags
  service_endpoints      = var.service_endpoints
  number_of_crypto_units = var.number_of_crypto_units
}
```

### Initialize HPCS Instance

```hcl
module "hpcs_init" {
  source             = "../../../modules/ibm-hpcs-initialisation/hpcs-init"
  tke_files_path     = var.tke_files_path
  input_file_name    = var.input_file_name
  hpcs_instance_guid = data.ibm_resource_instance.hpcs_instance.guid
}
```

### Manage HPCS Keys
`Note:` To Manage Keys, Instance should be Initialized..

```hcl
module "ibm-hpcs-kms-key" {
  source           = "../../modules/ibm-hpcs-kms-key/"
  instance_id      = data.ibm_resource_instance.hpcs_instance.guid
  name             = var.name
  standard_key     = var.standard_key
  force_delete     = var.force_delete
  endpoint_type    = var.endpoint_type
  key_material     = var.key_material
  encrypted_nonce  = var.encrypted_nonce
  iv_value         = var.iv_value
  expiration_date  = var.expiration_date
}
```

Note: COS Credententials are required when `download_from_cos` and `upload_to_cos` null resources are used


## Pre-Requisites for Initialisation:
* Login to IBM Cloud Account using cli `ibmcloud login --apikey= <Your IC Api Key> -a cloud.ibm.com`
* Target Resource group and region `ibmcloud target -g <resource group name>` `ibmcloud target -r <region>`
* Generate oauth-tokens `ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens`. This step should be done as and when token expires. 

## Notes On Initialization:
* The current script adds only one signature key admin.
* The signature key associated with the Admin name given in the json file will be selected as the current signature key.
* If number of master keys added is more than three, Master key registry will be `loaded`, `commited` and `setimmidiate` with last three added master keys.
* Please find the example json [here](./examples/ibm-hpcs-initialisation/references/input.json).
* Input can be fed in two ways either through local or through IBM Cloud Object Storage
* The input file is download from the cos bucket using `download_from_cos` null resource
* Secret TKE Files that are obtained after initialisation can be stored back in the COS Bucket as a Zip File using `upload_to_cos`null resource
* After uploading zip file to COS Bucket all the secret files and input file can be deleted from the local machine using `remove_tke_files` null resource.

## Future Enhancements:
* Automation of Pre-Requisites.
* Capability to add and select one or more admin.
* Integration with Hashicorp vault.
