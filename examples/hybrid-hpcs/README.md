# Hybrid-HPCS example

An example that creates the following infrastructure:

 - Create a new resource group if one is not passed in.
 - Create a new Hyper Protect Crypto Services instance that supports `Bring your own HSM`.

> Note: It requires a `hsm_connector_id` that will be provided by IBM. Currently this functionality is available to selected customers only.
