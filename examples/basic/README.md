# Basic example

An example that creates the following infrastructure:

 - Create a new resource group if one is not passed in.
 - Create a new Hyper Protect Crypto Services instance.


**Note:** This example doesn't initialize the service instance. There are multiple ways to initialize the service instance manually, refer [here](../../README.md#create-hyper-protect-crypto-services-instance)
